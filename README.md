# SAIBOðŸ¤–

A very short JRPG that contributes towards the conversation surrounding cybrogs, feminism, and bento-making in Japan.


## Run Locally

- Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/baxically/AST184_Game.git
```

- Go to the project directory in File Explorer
- Open AST184.exe




## Lessons Learned

While building SAIBO, I realized how difficult it was to build a video game by myself. I learned that being overly ambitious has its downfalls. My biggest challenge was learning how to save game states. I utilized Unity's documentation and threads on Stack Overflow to overcome this. 

## Future Plans

In the future, I would like to implement better game mechanics, develope SAIBO into a full fledged game, and design my own sprites.
