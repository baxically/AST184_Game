# SAIBOü§ñ
A very short JRPG that contributes towards the conversation surrounding cybrogs, feminism, and bento-making in Japan.

# Description
SAIBO is a top-down JRPG that was built using Unity. The plot centers around "Saibo," a cybrog husband, and his duty as a father. The goal of the game is to dimiss any suspicion of Saibo not being human. Through this game, I hope to promote the idea that women do not have to be the sole caregiver of the household (i.e in the sense of cleaning, making bentos, etc). I also want to show how cyborgs do not need to look feminine in order to do ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù tasks. By contributing to the conversation surrounding these topics, I hope that it will help in promoting the building of daycares in Japan so that the workload of parents are lessened in a way thatthey can start families again.

## Lessons Learned
During the development of SAIBO, I realized how difficult it was to create an entire video game all by myself. With the time I had, I was overly ambitious. I learned that it is okay to receive help and utilize resources. I also struggled with saving game states. I overcame this by utilizing Unity's 2D Video Game tutorial and threads on Stack Overflow.

## Future Plans
In the future, I would like to implement better game mechanics, develop SAIBO into a full game, and design my own sprites.
